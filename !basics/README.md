# Odin Basics Example

This program shows the most basic features of Odin. It is meant for total beginners.

To start learning, open `1_main.odin` and read from the top.

You can run the example by navigating to this folder in a command-prompt or terminal and typing:

```
odin run .
```

However, the output might not make much sense without reading the code.
